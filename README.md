# weather-visualization
Program takes NOAA data from weather stations surrounding Ann Arbor, MI over the period from 2005-2015 and visualizes recent changes in weather patterns.

Originally an assignment from Dr. Christopher Brooks' Coursera course - "Applied Data Science with Python". 

To run this program, please download the command file and execute it (if you are not on a mac, just run the file with python- you may have to change it to a .py file first).
Note, you should have the .csv file in this repository downloaded to the same directory as the .command file. The file that should be created is displayed in this github repository.
